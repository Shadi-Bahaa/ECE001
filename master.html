      <li><h3>Problem solving skill:</h3></li>
      <p>Problem solving skill is essential for creating effecient software applications. In problem solving, you learn how to solve real-life problems (and sometimes pure mathematics problems) using all properties, methodolgies, and libraries of the programming language considering the constraints of time and memory. In addition to the language, learning data structures and algorithms can add a lot to your solution. About resources, codeforces represents the most popular website for solving. For more difficult and interview-like problems, hackerrank and leetcode are preferred. </p>

      <li><h3>Large-scale projects:</h3></li>
      <p>Large-scale projects are not determined by huge number of codes only but also the variety of tools, technologies, and design methodologies. To create such projects, problem solving training is very helpful but isn't enough; one should learn design patterns and software engineering principles to create a strong project with no or little bugs. Additionally, learning frameworks is time-saving and high-effecient way to implement functions. Resources for studying such topics are listed in the last page.</p>

      <li><h3>Searching skill</h3></li>
      <p>It is the most important skill for all programmers; no one can remember everything, read large books, or find solutions for every problem by himself. Clearly, there is no methodology to improve this skill, it grows by time and intensive solving and creating projects. It may be helpful to search for how to find the best results for your search. The iframe can help you.</p>
